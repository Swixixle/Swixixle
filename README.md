# Alex Maksimovich

I design and build **cryptographically grounded, AI-adjacent infrastructure** for verification, auditability, and post-hoc interpretation.

My work focuses on **separating facts from claims**, **bytes from meaning**, and **proof from persuasion** — so systems can be trusted *without pretending to be wise*.

## Core Projects

### 🔐 HALO-RECEIPTS
**Minimal cryptographic receipts for byte-exact, SSH-signed audit artifacts.**

HALO-RECEIPTS proves only one thing:
> That specific bytes existed and were signed by a specific key.

It explicitly does **not** claim truth, intent, authorship, or meaning.  
Those interpretations are handled downstream via formal lenses (security, governance, evidence).

### 🕯 Lantern
**An interpretive framework and system for reasoning *about* artifacts without contaminating them.**

Lantern treats meaning as **external, contextual, and revisable** — never embedded into the artifact itself.  
It is designed for audits, governance review, post-incident analysis, and AI-assisted interpretation.

### 🧠 ELI
**Tools for structured explanation, reduction, and sense-making across complex systems.**

ELI focuses on clarity without distortion — explaining *what a system does* without editorializing *what it should mean*.

## Design Principles

- **Evidence before interpretation**
- **Cryptography before policy**
- **Separation of existence, intent, and meaning**
- **Auditability over aesthetics**
- **Systems that fail loudly, not politely**

---

## Current Focus

- Cryptographic verification pipelines
- AI-assisted audit and governance tooling
- Interpretive frameworks for high-risk systems
- Receipts, attestations, and post-hoc reasoning
